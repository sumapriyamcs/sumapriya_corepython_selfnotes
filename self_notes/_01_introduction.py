"""
WHAT IS PYTHON?

1.Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
2.Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted
programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to
develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of
high-level data structures.

3.Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language,
which makes it attractive for Application Development.

4.Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make
it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.

5.Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented,
 imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.

6.Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming.
 That is why it is known as multipurpose programming language
 because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.

7.We don't need to use data types to declare variable
because it is dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to assign
an integer value in an integer variable.

8.Python makes the development and debugging fast because
there is no compilation step included in Python development,
and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.

IT IS USED FOR:?

1.web development (server-side),
2.software development,
3.mathematics,
4.system scripting.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT CAN PYTHON DO:?

1.Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
2.Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
3.Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
4.Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
5.Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY PYTHON:?

1.Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
2.Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
3.Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines
than some other programming languages.

4.Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed
as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

5.Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PYTHON SYNTAX COMPARED TO OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES:

1.Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English
language with influence from mathematics.

2.Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming
languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.

3.Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope;
such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages
often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PYTHON FEATURES:?

1) Easy to Learn and Use

     Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages.
     Its syntax is straightforward and much the same as the English language.
     There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines
     the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners.

2) Expressive Language
    Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code.
    A simple example, the hello world program you simply type print("Hello World").
    It will take only one line to execute, while Java or C takes multiple lines.

3) Interpreted Language
     Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed
     one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.

4) Cross-platform Language

  Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX,
  and Macintosh, etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language.
  It enables programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms
  by writing a program only once.

5) Free and Open Source

  Python is freely available for everyone. It is freely available on its official website www.python.org
  It has a large community across the world that is dedicatedly working
  towards make new python modules and functions. Anyone can contribute to the Python community.
  The open-source means, "Anyone can download its source code without paying any penny."

6) Object-Oriented Language

   Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence.
  It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.

7) Extensible
   It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our Python code. It converts the program into byte code, and any platform can use that byte code.

8) Large Standard Library
    It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web developer, and also for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc. Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development.

9) GUI Programming Support
   Graphical User Interface is used for the developing Desktop application. PyQT5, Tkinter, Kivy are the libraries which are used for developing the web application.

10) Integrated
   It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, and JAVA, etc. Python runs code line by line like C,C++ Java. It makes easy to debug the code.

11. Embeddable
   The code of the other programming language can use in the Python source code. We can use Python source code in another programming language as well. It can embed other language into our code.

12. Dynamic Memory Allocation
In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable. When we assign some value to the variable, it automatically allocates the memory to the variable at run time. Suppose we are assigned integer value 15 to x, then we don't need to write int x = 15. Just write x = 15.

ADVANTAGES OF PYTHON:?
1. Easy to Read, Learn and Write

   Python is a high-level programming language that has English-like syntax. This makes it easier to read and understand the code.
   Python is really easy to pick up and learn, that is why a lot of people recommend Python to beginners. You need less lines of code to perform the same task as compared to other major languages like C/C++ and Java.

2. Improved Productivity

   Python is a very productive language. Due to the simplicity of Python, developers can focus on solving the problem. They don’t need to spend too much time in understanding the syntax or behavior of the programming language. You write less code and get more things done.

3. Interpreted Language

   Python is an interpreted language which means that Python directly executes the code line by line. In case of any error, it stops further execution and reports back the error which has occurred.
   Python shows only one error even if the program has multiple errors. This makes debugging easier.

4. Dynamically Typed

   Python doesn’t know the type of variable until we run the code. It automatically assigns the data type during execution. The programmer doesn’t need to worry about declaring variables and their data types.

5. Free and Open-Source

   Python comes under the OSI approved open-source license. This makes it free to use and distribute. You can download the source code, modify it and even distribute your version of Python. This is useful for organizations that want to modify some specific behavior and use their version for development.

6. Vast Libraries Support

   The standard library of Python is huge, you can find almost all the functions needed for your task. So, you don’t have to depend on external libraries.
   But even if you do, a Python package manager (pip) makes things easier to import other great packages from the Python package index (PyPi). It consists of over 200,000 packages.

7. Portability

   In many languages like C/C++, you need to change your code to run the program on different platforms. That is not the same with Python. You only write once and run it anywhere.


DISADVANTAGES OF PYTHON:?

1. Slow Speed

   We discussed above that Python is an interpreted language and dynamically-typed language. The line by line execution of code often leads to slow execution.
  The dynamic nature of Python is also responsible for the slow speed of Python because it has to do the extra work while executing code. So, Python is not u sed for purposes where speed is an important aspect of the project.

2. Not Memory Efficient

   To provide simplicity to the developer, Python has to do a little tradeoff. The Python programming language uses a large amount of memory. This can be a disadvantage while building applications when we prefer memory optimization.

3. Weak in Mobile Computing

   Python is generally used in server-side programming. We don’t get to see Python on the client-side or mobile applications because of the following reasons. Python is not memory efficient and it has slow processing power as compared to other languages.

4. Database Access

   Programming in Python is easy and stress-free. But when we are interacting with the database, it lacks behind.
   The Python’s database access layer is primitive and underdeveloped in comparison to the popular technologies like JDBC and ODBC.
   Huge enterprises need smooth interaction of complex legacy data and Python is thus rarely used in enterprises.

5. Runtime Errors

    As we know Python is a dynamically typed language so the data type of a variable can change anytime. A variable containing integer number may hold a string in the future, which can lead to Runtime Errors.
    Therefore Python programmers need to perform thorough testing of the applications.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS PYTHON IDLE?

  IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python. The Python installer for Windows contains the IDLE module by default.

  IDLE is not available by default in Python distributions for Linux. It needs to be installed using the respective package managers. Execute the following command to install IDLE on Ubuntu:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PYTHON IDEs?

   There are many free and commercial IDEs available for Python. Here, we will learn how to use some open-source editors to execute Python scripts or statements.

1.Jupyter Notebook

 The Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based graphical interface to the IPython shell. It allows the user to include formatted text, static and dynamic visualizations, mathematical equations, JavaScript widgets, etc. along with the Python code. The Jupyter Notebook document can be exported to PDF, Python script, or HTML.
 By default, the IPython kernel drives the Jupyter Notebook application. However, it supports other languages like Julia and R. (Jupyter stands for JUlia, PYThon, and R).

2.Visual Studio Code

   Visual Studio Code is an open-source IDE to develop different types of applications on Windows, Mac, and Linux platform. You can develop Python 3 applications by installing Python extension for VS Code from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

3.Online Python Shell

 Installing Python (or any software) can be a little daunting for a newbie. Fortunately there are many online resources to get familiar with the syntax, features and philosophy of Python before deciding to install Python in the local machine.
  You can launch an online Python Shell directly from the official website - https://www.python.org/shell.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES OF IDLE ARE:?

1.It is coded purely in python, using the tinker Graphical User Interface (GUI) toolkit.
2.It is cross-platform. It works smoothly and almost similarly on the operating systems.
3.It has a Python shell window in which you can write code, you get an error message and output also.
4.A multi-window editor is also available in IDLE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDLE Disadvantages

1 A file created using Python IDLE cannot be accessed from a device other than the one in which it is created unless being copied
into or sent to another device.
2 Changes are not saved automatically as we code.
3 It is not as advanced as its contemporaries.
4 Multi-window text editor with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, smart indent and other.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is Pycharm?
  Available as a cross-platform application, PyCharm is compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms. Sitting gracefully among the best Python IDEs, PyCharm provides support for both Python 2 (2.7) and Python 3 (3.5 and above) versions.
  PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language.
  It is developed by the Czech company JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ).

5.Code Completion
   PyCharm enables smoother code completion whether it is for built in or for an external package.
6.Git Visualization in Editor
     When coding in Python, queries are normal for a developer. You can check the last commit easily in PyCharm as it has the blue sections that can define the difference between the last commit and the current one.
7.Refactoring
   Refactoring is the process of renaming one or more files at a time and PyCharm includes various shortcuts for a smooth refactoring process.
8.Local History
    Local History is always keeping track of the changes in a way that complements like Git. Local history in PyCharm gives complete details of what is needed to rollback and what is to be added.
9.Package Management
    All the installed packages are displayed with proper visual representation. This includes list of installed packages and the ability to search and add new packages.
10.Code Coverage in Editor
  You can run .py files outside PyCharm Editor as well marking it as code coverage details elsewhere in the project tree, in the summary section etc.

what is Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

What can Visual Studio Code do?
Support for multiple programming languages:
  Supports multiple programming languages. So earlier, programmers needed Web-Support: a different editor for different languages, but it has built-in multi-language support. This also means it easily detects if there’s any fault or cross-language reference, it’ll be able to detect it easily.

Intelli-Sense:
    It can detect if any snippet of code is left incomplete. Also, common variable syntaxes and variable declarations are made automatically. Ex: If a certain variable is being used in the program and the user has forgotten to declare, intelli-sense will declare it for the user.

Cross-Platform Support:
     Traditionally, editors used to support either Windows or Linux or Mac Systems. But Visual Studio Code is cross-platform. So it can work on all three platforms. Also, the code works on all three platforms; else, the open-source and proprietary software codes used to be different.

Extensions and Support:
      Usually supports all the programming languages but, if the user/programmer wants to use the programming language which is not supported then, he can download the extension and use it. And performance-wise, the extension doesn’t slow down the editor as it rums as a different process.

Repository:
    With the ever-increasing demand for the code, secure and timely storage is equally important. It is connected with Git or can be connected with any other repository for pulling or saving the instances.

Web-Support:

    Comes with built-in support for Web applications. So web applications can be built and supported in VSC.

Hierarchy Structure:
    The code files are located in files and folders. The required code files also have some files, which may be required for other complex projects. These files can be deleted as per convenience.

Improving Code:
   Some code snippets can be declared a bit differently, which might help the user in the code. This function prompts the user, wherever necessary, to change it to the suggested option.

Terminal Support:
    Many of the times, the user needs to start from the root of the directory to start with a particular action, in-built terminal or console provides user support to not to switch in-between two screens for the same.

Multi-Projects:
   Multiple projects containing multiple files/folders can be opened simultaneously. These projects/folders might or might not be related to each other.

Git Support:
    Resources can be pulled from Git Hub Repo online and vice-versa; saving can be done too. Resource pulling also means cloning the code which is made available on the internet. This code can later be changed and saved.

Commenting:
     A common feature, but some of the languages do not support it. Commenting on the code helps the user to recall or track according to the sequence he wants.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visual Studio Code Advantages

1 1. Cross-platform support :
      Windows
       Linux
        Mac
2. Light-weight
3. Robust Architecture
4. Intelli-Sense
5. Freeware: Free of Cost- probably the best feature of all for all the programmers out there, even more for the organizations.
6. Many users will use it or might have used it for desktop applications only,
but it also provides great tool support for Web Technologies like; HTML, CSS, JSON.

Disadvantages
 1 Cut UI functionality in comparison of Visual Studio. Debug is not fully available as you can expect
 2 Not easy to install all necessary plugins to make the system stable
 3  Some annoying moments that always need to install the plugin after the next plugin... Sometimes plugin installation can force VS Code to crash.


Why do we need Visual Studio Code?
       Till recent times, there’s hardly been an IDE or code editor that has been so user-friendly that even first-time users can use each and every feature without any hassles.
       The coding-friendly feature and code error recognition also helps users a long way into making the code more efficient and error-less.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Anaconda IDE

Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing
(data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.),
that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

Advantages of Anaconda ide

1 It is free and open-source.
2 It has more than 1500 Python/R data science packages.
